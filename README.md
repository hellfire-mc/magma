# magma

Magma is a domain-switching reverse proxy for Minecraft servers.

It functions by reading the server address packet sent by the client during the login process, then switching packets to a number of routes based on this address, as specified in the proxy's config. You can think of Magma as NGINX for Minecraft.

Magma is still very much work in progress and is not production ready! Contributions are very much welcome.
