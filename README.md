# magma

Magma is a domain-switching reverse proxy for Minecraft servers.

It functions by reading the server address packet sent by the client during the login process, then switching packets to a number of routes based on this address, as specified in the proxy's config. You can think of Magma as NGINX for Minecraft.

🚧 **Warning** 🚧
 
Magma is still very much work in progress and is not production ready! Contributions are very much welcome.


## Configuration
